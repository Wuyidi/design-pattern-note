## Prototype (2)

### Implementing the clone operation

A small discussion appears when talking about how deep or shallow a clone should be: a deep clone clones the instance variables in the cloning object while a shallow clone shares the instance variables between the clone and the original. Usually, a shallow clone is enough and very simple, but cloning complex prototypes should use deep clones so the clone and the original are independent, a deep clone needing its components to be the clones of the complex objectâ€™s components.

#### Shallow Clone

**Clones only the first level properties**

- [commons-beanutils BeanUtils](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-beanutils/javadocs/v1.8.3/apidocs/org/apache/commons/beanutils/BeanUtils.html#cloneBean(java.lang.Object) in most cases
- [Spring BeanUtils](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.6/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/BeanUtils.html) if you are already using spring and hence have this utility on the class path

#### Deep Clone

**Clones the entire object hierarchy**

- [commons-lang SerializationUtils](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-release/org/apache/commons/lang3/SerializationUtils.html) Using serialization - if all classes are in your control and you can force implementing `Serializable`
- [Java Deep Cloning Library](https://github.com/kostaskougios/cloning/) Using reflection - in cases when the classes and the objects you want to clone are out of your control ( a 3-rd party library) and you can't make them implementing `Serializable`, or in cases you don't want to implement `Serializable`.

#### Deep Clones vs. Shallow Clones 

when we clone complex objects which contains other objects, we should take care how they are cloned. We can clone contained objects also (deep cloning) or we can the same reference for them, and to share them between cloned container objects (shallow cloning).

#### Shallow Copy Vs Deep Copy in Java

**Below is the list of differences between shallow copy and deep copy in java.**

| Shallow Copy                                                 | Deep Copy                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cloned Object and original object are not 100% disjoint.     | Cloned Object and original object are 100% disjoint.         |
| Any changes made to cloned object will be reflected in original object or vice versa. | Any changes made to cloned object will not be reflected in original object or vice versa. |
| Default version of clone method creates the shallow copy of an object. | To create the deep copy of an object, you have to override clone method. |
| Shallow copy is preferred if an object has only primitive fields. | Deep copy is preferred if an object has references to other objects as fields. |
| Shallow copy is fast and also less expensive.                | Deep copy is slow and very expensive.                        |

**Below is the example which creates the shallow copy of an object weekly log with an attachment**

```java
import java.util.logging.Logger;
class Attachment {
    private String name;
   
    public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
    }
    
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public void download() {
		LOGGER.log("Start downloading attachment: " + name);
    }
}
```

```java
class WeeklyLog implements Cloneable {
    private Attachment attachment;
    private String name;
    private String date;
    private String content;
    
    // get set method
    [...]
    
    // Shallow Copy
    public WeeklyLog clone() {
        Object obj = null;
        try {
            obj = super.clone();
            return (WeeklyLog)obj;
        } catch(CloneNotSupportedException e) {
            LOGGER.log("Error: clone is not supported")
			return null;
        }
    }
}
```

```java
class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		WeeklyLog log1 = new WeeklyLog();
        Attachment attachment = new Attachment();
        log1.setAttachment(attachment);
        WeeklyLog log2 = log1.clone();
        // Compare weekly log (false)
        LOGGER.log("log1 is the same with log2: " + (log1 == log2))
        // Compare their attachment (true)
        LOGGER.log("Whether the attachment is the same: " 
			+ (log1.getAttachment() == log2.getAttachment());
	}
}
```

The result of comparing the references of their attachment object is true, so the shallow copy of an object will have exact copy of all the fields of original object. If original object has any references to other objects as fields, then only references of those objects are copied into clone object, copy of those objects are not created. That means any changes made to those objects through clone object will be reflected in original object or vice-versa.

**Below is the example which creates the deep copy of an object weekly log with an attachment**

A typical way of implementing a deep clone is to go through a class and write code to create new objects and copy over all of the values to these new objects. This can be a time-consuming process if the object being cloned is complicated. A simple way of performing a deep clone is for all of the classes that make up a class to implement the Serializable interface. If this is the case, we can serialize all of the values of the object and then deserialize all of these values to a new object. This in essence is a shortcut to performing a deep copy, since all of the values get copied over into new objects.

```java
import java.io.*
class WeeklyLog implements Serializable {
	private Attachment attachment;
	private String name;
	private String date;
	private String content;
	
	// get set method
	[...]
	// Using serialization implement deep copy
	public WeeklyLog deepClone() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException,
    OptionalDataException {
    	ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    	ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);
    	oos.writeObject(this);
    	
    	ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());
    	ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis);
    	return (WeeklyLog)ois.readObject();
    }
}
```
