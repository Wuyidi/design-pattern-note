## Design Pattern Concept (1)

> The design pattern are description of communicating objects and classes that are customize to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

In general design pattern has four essential elements:

1. **pattern name**

   > The **pattern name** is a handle we can use to describe a design problem, itssolutions, and consequences in a word or two. Naming a pattern immediately increases our design vocabulary. It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction. Having a vocabulary for patterns lets us talk about them with our colleagues, in our documentation, and even to ourselves. It makes iteasier to think about designs and to communicate them and their trade-offsto others. 

2. **problem**

   > The **problem** describes when to use the pattern. It explains the problem and its context. It might describe specific design problems such as how to respresent algorithms as object. It might describe a object or class structures that are symptomatic of an inflexible design. Sometimes the problem will include a list of conditions that must be met before it make sense to apply the pattern.

3. **solution**

   > The **solution** describe the elements that make up the design, their relationship, resposibilities, and collaborations. The **solution** doesn't describe a particular concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.  Instead, the pattern provide an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arragement of elements (classes or objects) sloves it.

4. **consequence**

   > The **consequences** are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern. Though consequences are often unvoiced when we describe design decisions,they are critical for evaluating design alternatives and for understandingthe costs and benefits of applying the pattern. The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs. They may address language and implementation issues as well. Since reuse is often a factor inobject-oriented design, the consequences of a pattern include its impacton a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability. Listing these consequences explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them.
