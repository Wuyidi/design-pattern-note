## Interface Segregation Principle (接口隔离原则)

### Motivation

When we design an application we should take care how we are going to make abstract a module which contains several submodules. Considering the module implemented by a class, we can have an abstraction of the system done in an interface. But if we want to extend our application adding another module that contains only some of the submodules of the original system, we are forced to implement the full interface and to write some dummy methods. Such an interface is named fat interface or polluted interface. Having an interface pollution is not a good solution and might induce inappropriate behavior in the system.

> The **Interface Segregation Principle** states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use. Instead of one fat interface many small interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, each one serving one submodule.

### Intent

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
